# Mammut RPG Manifesto

## We Mammothians are players

We share a passion for games, and are actively committed to playing and letting people play.

We acknowledge gaming as a fully legitimate form of social-artistic expression. For us, gaming is not just a form of fun, but a new form of expression: an experience created by rules.

Even before creating, translating, revising, laying out, and illustrating, we play and we are strongly convinced that play should happen before any and all these steps, to inform them and give them purpose.

Therefore, we believe it is necessary:
- to play *before* creating (because other people's games are a source of inspiration);
- to play *before* translating (because a correct translation requires a solid understanding of the game);
- to play *before* editing (because the text of a game is better after playing it);
- to play *before* laying out the text (because the game, as a physical or digital object, must be of service to the act of play);
- to play *before* illustrating (because the illustrations must convey atmosphere to the players).

We respect those who play with us and we do so before, during, and after the game. Gaming is a social activity, and people are its primary, constituent material. We believe that forgetting about them, or worse, disrespecting them is a serious fault. Therefore, we are committed to ensuring that at our tables everyone plays with respect and sensitivity.

We play games as they were created, trying to understand their structure and mechanics, because we think we should trust the game’s author. If we decide to get our hands “under the hood” of a game, hacking it or changing its rules, we make sure we have played it and understood how it works, first.

## We Mammothians are creators

We believe in coherent design and in the importance of actual play (i.e. the analysis of verified or verifiable game cases). We believe it is essential that the rules and procedures of a game are thought out, designed, and tested in order to ensure that the game facilitates the emergence of a certain range of gaming experiences, and not others.

We believe in games—as physical or digital objects—produced with passion and professionalism. We strongly support Creative Commons licenses, the use of illustrations and fonts released under free licenses, and the need to credit the work of others.

We believe that another publishing model is possible. We believe that the classic publishing system applied to role-playing games is now unsustainable. We are therefore convinced that the time has come for a model that is based on the use of the Internet, on a greater spread of electronic formats (first and foremost PDF and ebook) and on the presence in fairs and events that go beyond the typical context of games and comics.

## We Mammothians are communicators

We believe in assertive and inclusive communication. We avoid controversies for their own sake and are committed to always provide our point of view in a respectful ways.

## Finally, we Mammothians are enthusiasts

We are curious, and we aim to share our curiosity and knowledge with enthusiasm, without being conceited or patronising. We also believe in the plurality of our passions and we believe that the encounter between them is crucial and fruitful.
